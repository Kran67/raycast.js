This is a simple implementation of the once-popular 3-D rendering technique known as "ray-casting" which was featured in the video game Wolfenstein 3D.

All of the rendering is carried out within a single `800x600` canvas for the sake of simplicity at ~30 frames per second.

This little project was inspired by a video on YouTube posted by a fellow seasoned programmer who goes by the name `javidx9`. You can follow [this link](https://youtu.be/xW8skO7MFYw) to refer to his tutorial of ray-casting done entirely on a command-line window!

### Setting up
#### Requirements
- Python (preferably 3.7)
- `pip`
- `virtualenv`

Upon downloading the source files, navigate to the root folder and run the command below to create a brand-new virtualenv to work on.

`$ virtualenv <name_of_the_virtual_env> -p python3.7`

Don't forget to activate the virtualenv you've just created.

`$ source bin/activate`

Then, using pip, install the dependencies.

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once all the dependencies are installed, you can start up a Flask development server with:

`$ python3.7 src/serve.py`

### Live Demo

You can check out the live demo [here](https://raycasting-demo.herokuapp.com)!

### Controls
- Use keys `W` and `S` on your keyboard to move forwards and backwards, respectively.
- Key `A` rotates player counter-clockwise, and key `D` rotates player clockwise. 
- Use keys `Q` and `E` to strafe left and right, respectively.
- Use `SPACE` to shoot.
- Use `ENTER` to open/close doors.

### Features
- Walking animation
- Skybox rendering
- Shading with distance
- Doors

### TODOs
- Texture-mapping
- World-object sprites
- Diagonal walls
- Transparent walls
- (Efficient) Floor-casting
